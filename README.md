- This project aims to predict customer churn, i.e., whether a customer continues with their account or closes it. Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses as it helps in identifying at-risk customers and devising strategies to retain them.
- The prediction is based on various customer attributes provided in the dataset, such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, estimated salary, geography, and gender.
